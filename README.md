# iRecMagicTV_Android
MagicTV EasyRecorder is a frontend for the MagicTV iRec web site. 

This project has been in Play Store before, but was put down due to infringement of copyright (Most likely due to the icon). I have determined not to put it back to Play Store and cease development of the project following the submission failure of iOS version.

### Basic Information

I understand that usage of exception in GPL v2 is not valid legally, but I will do my best to publicize any violators.

### Notes on Ads By Google

This project has Ads By Google built in, however the AdMob Unit ID has been removed from the project so I will not gain any revenue by usage of the code.
